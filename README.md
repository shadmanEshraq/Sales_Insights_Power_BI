## üìù The Story Behind / Problem Statement  <a name = "a_0_TSB"></a>

<p align="justified"> 
An Indian company has been in computer hardware importing and selling business for four years. They sell their products all over India, resulting in revenue in the range of millions. They usually use Excel and SQL to analyze the business data. However, they want to use Power BI for better visualization so they can make more informed business decisions. So they gathered a team of data analysts to make a dashboard analyzing the sales data. The final goal is to unlock sales insights that were not visible before. 

As a result, the sales team can make better, data-driven decisions. Moreover, they wish to automate some of the data analysis tasks some employees can spend their working hours on some other tasks to move the business forward.
